Journey on tech career
Probably (I hope) my english will be improved in the next months, but I'll try to get used to it.
If you're reading this, dear hirer, lsten to my words (actually, read them). I've got a passion on technology that I aways kept inside my heart and, besides not having any portifolio at all (and experience), I'm sure that my passion and will to learn worth my hiring!

- [x] Be brave giving the first step on career changing;
- [ ] Be hired.
